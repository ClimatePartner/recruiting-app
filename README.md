## Introduction/Expectations

Throughout the project, you will see `TODO` comments indicating outstanding tasks. The order in which the tasks are completed is up to you to decide, how you approach the tasks is part of how we will get to understand the way in which you work. While knowledge of modern frameworks will be useful, it is not required in order to complete the tasks. Where some knowledge of framework specifics would be good to know, you will find already working examples that should help in completing the tasks.

Important files to take note of are:

- server/index.ts
- src/api.ts
- src/App.tsx
- src/OrderForm.tsx
